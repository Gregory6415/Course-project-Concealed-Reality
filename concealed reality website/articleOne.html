            <p>After 4 years from the initial released of SYNAPSES our music is still streamed, we did 9.6K this
                year.
                Yet with the band we still have something for you, the most complex and darkest track we ever made.
                As
                we all want to move forward and don't get held by this unreleased song, we are finally decided to
                give
                it to you. We're not expecting anything, just wanting to make peace in our mind. Let us a bit of
                time to
                figure out the release since this is a very fast decision took for the celebration of Synapses 4
                years
                old. </p>
